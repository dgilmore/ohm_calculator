### ohmCalculator.js

* This componenent holds all of the logic and UI for the calculator. 
* I choose to used dropdown menus from a pre-defined list of the colors and values defined from the [wikipedia entry for resistors.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code) 

### ohmCalculator.test.js
* I am not very familiar with testing React apps. I was attempting to use Jest & Enzyme to run unit tests. I struggled to get mock functions to run properly. I understand after reading much more about testing now, that I could have made my life much easier by creating the tests first and writing my components based on the tests.
